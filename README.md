## 🎥 Recording

There was an Advanced Challenge Lab session, that was recorded and had a lot of information and showcase of Vibe Coding using a similar template in Rust.
Even in Rust the core logic and add-ons to this template are the same.

You can see here the full recording: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuNUy13wmlI

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🧑‍💻 1. Get Codespace Ready

A **devcontainer** is preconfigured for you to start coding instantly!

- Click on "Use this Template" → "Create a new repository".
- Click "Code → Open with Codespaces"
- Change machine type to 4-core 16GB RAM • 32GB
- Once the codespace is created, you can open it in VS Code Local
- Everything is pre-installed and ready for you to run the following commands

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
mops install
```

### 3. Running Ollama

To be able to test the agent locally, you'll need a server for processing the agent's prompts. For that, we'll use `ollama`, which is a tool that can download and serve LLMs.
See the documentation on the [Ollama website](https://ollama.com/). Run:

```bash
ollama serve
# Expected to start listening on port 11434
```

The above command will start the Ollama server, so that it can process requests by the agent. Additionally, and in a separate window, run the following command to download the LLM that will be used by the agent:

```bash
ollama run llama3.1:8b
```

Once the command executes and the model is loaded, you can terminate it by typing /bye. You won't need to do this step again.

### 4. Deployment

Then, in one terminal window, run:

```bash
dfx start --clean
```

Keep this tab open for reading logs.

Then pull the dependency and deploy the canisters in another window:

```bash
dfx deploy # deploys the backend and frontend canisters
```

```bash
dfx deps pull
dfx deps deploy  # deploys the llm canister
```

### 5. Start the Development Server

You can start the frontend development server with:

```bash
# Just the frontend development server
npm start

```

### 6. Run Tests

```bash
npm test
```

You can also run:

```bash
npm test tests/src/backend.test.ts    # individual test
```

## 🔄 CI/CD Workflow

Located under `.github/workflows/`, this includes:

- 🧪 Automated end-2-end test runs

It could be extended to:

- check for security updates (audit);
- test coverage;
- code quality.

---

## 🧠 **GitHub Copilot Integration**

This project leverages two key customization folders:

- `.github/instructions/` – Provides essential context to guide AI responses.
- `.github/prompts/` – Defines workflow prompts to effectively assist you.

Think of the AI as a super-fast junior developer, handling the heavy lifting while you focus on quality control. Instead of using PRs, you’re reviewing and refining code directly in the IDE through Copilot chat.

### 📝 **About Instructions**

Instructions provide "context" that applies to specific files using regex patterns defined in `applyTo`. They are ideal for project-wide or language-specific guidance.

**Current Instructions:**

- **general:** `applyTo: **`
- **motoko:** `applyTo: */*.mo`
- **test:** `applyTo: tests/**`

**Examples of Context You Can Define:**

- This is an ICP project using Motoko canisters.
- For Motoko, we follow standard style guides and linting tools.
- For tests, we use **Pocket IC** and maintain a specific test structure.

### 🛠️ **About Prompts**

Prompts define specific tasks and guide the AI through a structured workflow. They are especially useful for maintaining a consistent development process.

---

#### ✨ **Add Feature Prompt**

```markdown
/add-feature Add a function to decrease the counter value
```

In this workflow, Copilot follows a Spec Driven Workflow:

1. Clarification Phase:
   • Updates the changelog and asks for any necessary clarifications.
2. Test First Approach:
   • Generates a test case and ensures it fails, confirming that the test is effectively targeting the desired behavior.
3. Human Confirmation:
   • The AI pauses for a human to review and confirm the spec, ensuring alignment before proceeding.
4. Implementation Phase:
   • Implements the code, self-checks for errors, installs necessary libraries, lints, formats, and runs tests to confirm they pass.

**✅ Key Takeaways**

When you explore the prompt, please notice:

- CRITICAL PAUSE POINTS
  - Strategic pauses allow the human to verify the work in small, reviewable chunks and redirect if necessary.
- Command Explanations
  - The prompt can include specific commands or scripts, guiding the AI in self-checking, running scripts, or managing dependencies.
- Task-Specific Advice
  - The prompt is the place to add any specific guidance or notes relevant only to the particular task at hand.

#### 🚧 **Changes Review Prompt**

To run a review, simply call the prompt:

```markdown
/changes-review
```

The AI will analyze the current git diffs, then reference other files in the repo for context. It will generate a comprehensive report for you to review before committing.

#### ✅ **Focus Areas**

1. **Business Logic:**

   - Detects potential unwanted side effects or missing edge cases.

2. **Code Quality:**

   - Suggests improvements or refactor opportunities.

3. **Security & Performance:**
   - Identifies vulnerabilities or inefficiencies.

#### 📌 **Why It Matters**

- AI can handle the heavy lifting, but it's **your responsibility as the Senior** to validate the findings.
- Double-check and ensure quality – small issues now can become big problems later. 😉
